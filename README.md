# ShapeDNA



A python implementation of the finite element discretization of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, following the steps presented  in [1].


## Input:
A two-manifold triangle mesh as a Wavefront OBJ file.

## Output:
The spectrum, i.e. eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the two-manifold triangle mesh.
